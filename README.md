# 🚀 React-MasterClass
This repository contains all projects, exercises, and practice modules completed while studying **Jonas Schmedtmann’s** Master Modern React course.

The goal of this repo is to document my progress while learning modern React development — including components, hooks, state management, React Query, Context API, Redux, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and advanced patterns.

Over time, each module will be added as its own folder, with working code samples and notes.

# 📚 Modules & Projects
--- 
## ⭐ 03 - A First Look at React
- **Overview:** A quick intro into Pure React.  A minimal, framework-free React setup using the React and ReactDOM UMD CDN scripts. Instead of using bundlers or build tools like Vite, Webpack, or Create React App, this example runs React directly in the browser inside a single HTML file.

## ⭐ 05 - Thinking in React (Pizza Menu) 🍕
- **Overview:** Built a multi-component pizza menu app using the "Thinking in React" workflow, focusing on breaking the UI into reusable components. Practiced props, conditional rendering, and mapping dynamic data to the UI.
