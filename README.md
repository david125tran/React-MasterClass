## ⭐ 03 - A First Look at React
- **Overview:** A quick intro into Pure React.  A minimal, framework-free React setup using the React and ReactDOM UMD CDN scripts. Instead of using bundlers or build tools like Vite, Webpack, or Create React App, this example runs React directly in the browser inside a single HTML file.

## ⭐ 05 - Thinking in React (Pizza Menu) 🍕
- **Overview:** A multi-component pizza menu app using the "Thinking in React" workflow, focusing on breaking the UI into reusable components. Practiced props, conditional rendering, and mapping dynamic data to the UI.

## ⭐ 06 - State, Events & Step Components

- **Overview:** An interactive step-tracker / wizard UI to practice core React concepts including `useState`, event handlers, conditional rendering, and dynamic styling. Users can navigate between steps using Previous / Next buttons while the active step and message update in real time.
