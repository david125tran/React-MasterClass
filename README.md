# 📚 Modules & Projects
--- 
## ⭐ 03 - A First Look at React
- **Overview:** A quick intro into Pure React.  A minimal, framework-free React setup using the React and ReactDOM UMD CDN scripts. Instead of using bundlers or build tools like Vite, Webpack, or Create React App, this example runs React directly in the browser inside a single HTML file.

## ⭐ 05 - Thinking in React (Pizza Menu) 🍕
- **Overview:** A multi-component pizza menu app using the "Thinking in React" workflow, focusing on breaking the UI into reusable components. Practiced props, conditional rendering, and mapping dynamic data to the UI.

## ⭐ 06 - State, Events & Step Components

- **Overview:** An interactive step-tracker / wizard UI to practice core React concepts including `useState`, event handlers, conditional rendering, and dynamic styling. Users can navigate between steps using Previous / Next buttons while the active step and message update in real time.

## ⭐ 07 - Thinking in React: State Management

- **Overview:**  Focuses on identifying what data should live in state, where that state should live, and how it should flow through the component tree. Builds the static usePopcorn UI using hard-coded data while practicing lifting state, deriving values from state, and structuring components around a single source of truth.

## ⭐ 11 - How React Works Behind the Scenes
- **Overview:** Explores how React renders and re-renders components based on state changes. Uses a tab system to demonstrate how component identity, keys, batching of state updates, functional state setters, and asynchronous updates affect rendering behavior and state consistency. Shows why state can appear “stale”, how React batches updates, and how remounting resets component state.

## ⭐ 12 - Effects and Data Fetching
- **Overview:**  This is a continuation of **Module 07**.  Introduces side effects in React by connecting the usePopcorn app to the OMDb API. Emphasizes using useEffect for data fetching, synchronizing state with external systems (API, keyboard, document title), handling cleanup, and managing async race conditions to keep UI and state consistent.
